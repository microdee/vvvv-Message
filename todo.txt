Features accomplished
- wasChanged as a solid property of Message, or maybe even Bin (leave a managed breadcrumb of the last sync'ing Keep)
- dx ressources as valid type in Formular and pintype
- less Gui windows
- AutoSense should be called Force, and polarity reverse (breaking change?!)
- formular selection pin is still called "Message Formular" - shorter, loose the "Message" here
- [Split] should have a verbose toggle
- [ConfigKeep] BinSize of 0 on first slice somehow affects all other nodes. Should maybe also delete 
- Reader (Message Stream) should not output Messages when reading is off. AutoReset at EOF is dull too. Count of -1 should read all (Min=-1)
- [Read] AvoidNil is crap. More useful: swapdim 
- Profiles (extending TypeIdentity) should look prettier. 

Features Wanted
- vl version (message core only, best done by tonfilms xml, not attributes)
- autocast from any vl class (and mimick back), might need converters for all vvvv special types
- dynamic object wrapper for a Message's dictionary (see Agent in vvvv-Game)
- faster TypeIdentity - split into two internal dictionaries
 - pin order fully deterministic

Bugs
- [Formular] is super slow
- [ConfigKeep] does not stop sweeping
- [PruneBut] does not remove empty bins
- [PruneEmpty] fix help text


Treatments
- config pin should be private (and hidden)
